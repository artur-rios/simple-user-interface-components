# Simple User Interface components (SUIC) -  Framework agnostic version

## Get started

- Run `npm i simple-user-interface-components` to install the library package into your project
- Export the library using a js file, this way: `export * as SUIC from "../node_modules/simple-user-interface-components/dist/js/suic.min.js";`
- Add the js file in every html page you'll use the components
- In order for the components to work properly you need to add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />` in your html head
- You can find examples of usage inside each component folder, on the `tests.html` file
